Users can use the application to ask and answer questions through active involvement, vote up or down on questions and answers, and modify questions and answers in a similar way to Reddit. Doubtpinch users can gain trust points. For example, obtaining an "up" vote on an answer to a question earns a person 5 trust points, of the standard Q&A site.
